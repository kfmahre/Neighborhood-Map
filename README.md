# Neighborhood-Map
OK, This is my version of Udacity's FEND Project-5: Neighborhood Map Project

## Still in progress

So far I had the whole frame of the site set up. There is a goggle map with markers pinned on my locations. There is listview of my model that changes the view with the bindings I've got set up with KO. There is a searchbar with no functionality. I've got the skeleton of a wiki Ajax request in my app.js file.

TODO from this point: Add searchbar filter functionality. Neaten up code & explain what's going on in there.

Also: get a weather API to work
