# Neighborhood-Map
This is my version of Udacity's FEND Project-5: Neighborhood Map Project

## What it does:
I have a number of trailhead locations hardcoded into the app.

If you click on a marker or a list item, the marker will bounce and it's infowidow will open displaying the current weather via Weather Underground's API and a wikipedia link on the selected trailhead location.

If you type into the search field the marker and list will only display the ones who's names match what's typed into the search field.

I disabled some additional features that I will bring back in to make this portfolio ready, but for now I'm focused on getting this project passed in review.

## To run the app:
